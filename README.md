# Flask-Blog-App

### OVERVIEW:

This is a web-application developed using Flask framework of Python. This is a blogging website with features like register a new user,
login user, a home page showing all the posts broken into multiple pages (pagination), user account page, a create post page wherein the
user can create a post by giving a title and providing the details in the content section of the create post page and simply upload by 
clicking on the upload button. The user can set up an account by going on the register section at the top of the application and then would
be redirected to the login page. The user can also upload his/her profile picture, but if not, then a default profile picture will be shown
on his/her profile. All the users are registered and the data is saved into a database, created using Flask_SQLAlchemy extension that adds 
support for SQLAlchemy to the application. The about page is basically showing text about the website.
